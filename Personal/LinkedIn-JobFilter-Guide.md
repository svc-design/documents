## 🔍 5. Message & Screening Tips (Avoiding Outsourcing)

| Recruiter Message | Interpretation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| “Client-based project” | 🚫 Outsourcing |
| “We collaborate with major banks” | 🚫 Outsourcing |
| “You will work on-site at customer’s location” | 🚫 Outsourcing |
| “We provide training before deployment” | 🚫 Fake / Training company |
| “Internal platform role within our company” | ✅ Genuine in-house position |
| “Tech stack includes K8s / Terraform / GitOps / Observability” | ✅ High-relevance real role |

---

## 🧠 6. Advanced Strategy: Cross-Verification

When in doubt, cross-check the company’s real postings:
1. Search the **same company** on LinkedIn’s official page
   → verify that the **recruiter** is an *internal HR* or *engineering manager*, not an “Agency”.
2. Check the **domain email** used in communication (e.g., `@company.com`, not `@staffing.cn`).
3. Compare with Indeed / Glassdoor job board listings for consistency.
