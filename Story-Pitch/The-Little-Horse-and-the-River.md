🐴 Story Title: The Little Horse and the River

Once upon a time, there was a little horse who wanted to cross a river.
He needed to bring a bag of wheat to the mill on the other side.
But when he reached the river, he didn’t know how deep the water was.
He was afraid.

He asked a cow,
“Hey, have you crossed this river before?”
The cow said, “Of course! The water is very shallow. You can walk easily.”
Then he asked a squirrel,
“Have you crossed the river?”
The squirrel said, “It’s so deep! I almost drowned!”

The little horse was confused — who should he believe?
Finally, his mother came and said,
“My dear, don’t just listen to others. Try it yourself.”

So, the little horse walked into the river.
At first, the water was cold and scary.
But step by step, he found it wasn’t too deep.
He crossed the river safely and felt proud — he had learned to face challenges himself.

🌍 Reflection: The River of Change

Today, our world is like that river — always changing.
Technology, jobs, and society move fast.
Sometimes people tell us, “It’s easy!”
Others say, “It’s too hard!”
But just like the little horse, we must try, learn, and adapt.

In our work, we face new tools, new cultures, new ways to communicate.
If we stop because of fear, we never cross the river.
If we move forward bravely, we find new possibilities.

So, I believe we are all that little horse —
crossing our own rivers, learning, growing,
and finding our strength in a world of change.

Thank you. 🌈
