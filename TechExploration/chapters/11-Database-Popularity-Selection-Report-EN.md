1. Overview

This report provides a guide for database selection in Q4 2025, aiming to help organisations and developers choose the right database systems. We reference the DB‑Engines Ranking (October 2025) and official documentation. The report analyses popularity, features, performance and use cases for major databases. DB‑Engines system pages describe each database, such as PostgreSQL (an open‑source relational DBMS with full ACID support
db-engines.com
), MySQL (a widely‑used open source relational DB
db-engines.com
), MongoDB (a document‑oriented database supporting multi‑document transactions
db-engines.com
), Redis (an in‑memory key‑value store
db-engines.com
), and ClickHouse (a high‑performance column‑oriented OLAP DB
db-engines.com
). These descriptions form the basis for comparing database features.

8. Future Trends & Recommendations

Rise of Cloud‑Native DBs – Distributed SQL databases like TiDB and YugabyteDB will become enterprise standards, tightly integrating with container platforms.

Vector DB Integration – Tools like pgvector and Milvus will merge with relational DBs, powering efficient retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) in large language models.

Time‑Series & OLAP Convergence – Systems such as ClickHouse and StarRocks are incorporating time‑series aggregation and AI analytics, blurring boundaries between TSDB and OLAP.

Security & Multi‑tenant Isolation – With increasing adoption of DBaaS, fine‑grained permissions and zero‑trust architectures will be essential.

Geo‑replication as a Key Capability – Cross‑region replication is critical for compliance and high availability; NewSQL and cloud platforms will invest heavily in this area.
