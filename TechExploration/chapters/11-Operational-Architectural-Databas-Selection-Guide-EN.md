Overview

This guide builds upon the previous Database Popularity & Selection Report and tailors its recommendations for DevOps engineers and system architects. Beyond popularity, functionality and performance, operations‑oriented selection emphasises high availability, reliability, scalability, operational complexity, and integration with monitoring, backup and disaster‑recovery tooling. The context remains Q4 2025, and authoritative sources such as DB‑Engines and official documentation are cited.

High Availability & Scalability Features

For operations teams, high availability and horizontal scalability are top priorities. The following highlights each system’s replication and failover characteristics (from official docs):

Redis – The documentation states that enabling replication duplicates the dataset, creating a replica synchronized with the primary. Replication allows automatic failover and improves fault tolerance, preventing data loss in hardware or zone failures
redis.io
. Redis Cloud offers single‑zone and multi‑zone replication options
redis.io
.

Elasticsearch – DB‑Engines notes that it uses sharding and replication across nodes
db-engines.com
. Elasticsearch operates under eventual consistency with configurable write‑consistency levels
db-engines.com
.

InfluxDB – Only the enterprise edition supports selectable replication factors and sharding
db-engines.com
; the open‑source version lacks built‑in high availability.

VictoriaMetrics – Supports synchronous replication
db-engines.com
, making it suitable for monitoring workloads requiring redundant copies.

Kafka – The official site emphasises Kafka’s high throughput and persistent storage, with deployment across geographic regions for high availability
kafka.apache.org
. Its partition and replica mechanism tolerates node failures.

NewSQL (TiDB/CockroachDB) – These systems offer native distributed ACID transactions and automatic replication with failover
db-engines.com
, including geo‑partitioning.

Operators must also evaluate backup & restore capabilities, online scale‑out/upgrade support, and the maturity of Kubernetes operators. Managed services such as Redis Cloud and Elasticsearch Service handle backups, upgrades and monitoring automatically, while TiDB Operator or Crunchy Data provide container‑native management.

Operations‑oriented Feature Comparison

The table extends the original feature comparison by adding an “Ops focus” column summarising high availability and operational complexity. Keywords provide at‑a‑glance guidance.

Database	High Availability	Operational Complexity	Ops Notes
PostgreSQL	Streaming replication; tools like Citus/Patroni provide sharding and automatic failover	Medium	Requires managing primary‑replica or cluster setups, WAL monitoring and backups; supported Kubernetes operators and automation
MySQL	Master‑slave and group replication; Percona XtraDB Cluster provides synchronous replication	Medium	Group Replication enhances consistency; demands careful topology & GTID management; InnoDB logs and backups need tuning
MongoDB	Replica sets for replication and automatic primary election; supports sharded clusters	Medium‑High	Sharded clusters scale well but add configuration complexity; monitoring heartbeats, elections and balancers; Ops Manager available
Redis	Replica replication and Sentinel/Cluster for high availability; managed services support multi‑zone replication
redis.io
	Low–Medium	Single instance is easy; HA requires Sentinel or Cluster; memory persistence and RDB/AOF tuning are critical
ClickHouse	Replicated tables and distributed tables deliver HA; relies on ZooKeeper or ClickHouse Keeper	Medium	Adding nodes requires shard & replica management; weaker consistency; backup & recovery rely on external tools; Kubernetes operators exist
Kafka	Partitions and replicas provide durability & failover
kafka.apache.org
	Medium	Broker expansion requires rebalancing partitions; monitoring lag and ISR (in‑sync replicas) counts is critical; Zookeeper/Quorum adds complexity
Milvus	Distributed architecture with multiple replicas
db-engines.com
	Medium	Ops must manage shard balancing and GPU resources; vector index builds are resource intensive
InfluxDB	Enterprise edition offers replication and sharding
db-engines.com
; OSS lacks native HA	Low–Medium	HA requires commercial license; monitor write/query latency; backups are simple but should be frequent
Elasticsearch	Sharding & replica mechanism provides redundancy
db-engines.com
; cross‑cluster replication	Medium‑High	Cluster topology and shard/replica counts affect performance; monitor heap and GC; snapshots and ILM support automation
VictoriaMetrics	Synchronous replication supported
db-engines.com
; lightweight for monitoring	Low	Single‑node handles high QPS; cluster mode needs replication topology; fits cloud‑native monitoring as a Prometheus alternative
TiDB / CockroachDB	Automatic triplicate storage & failover
db-engines.com
	Medium	Deploy multi‑node clusters using PD/placement driver; supports elastic scaling and online scheduling; operators available
Operations‑oriented Recommendations

These recommendations focus on high availability, scalability and ease of management for common DevOps scenarios:

Critical transactional workloads – Choose NewSQL systems (TiDB, CockroachDB) or PostgreSQL with Patroni for strong consistency and automatic failover
db-engines.com
. They offer native distributed transactions and geo‑replication.

Caching & session management – Redis provides simple deployment with rapid failover; for multi‑data‑centre setups use multi‑zone replication
redis.io
 or consider Dragonfly to reduce memory fragmentation.

Logging & monitoring – Combine ClickHouse with Kafka for high‑throughput log ingestion
kafka.apache.org
. VictoriaMetrics or InfluxDB Enterprise offer replicable time‑series storage
db-engines.com
; Elasticsearch suits full‑text log search but has higher ops overhead
db-engines.com
.

Real‑time streaming – Kafka or Pulsar provide mature partition & replica models; Redpanda simplifies deployment by removing the JVM. Combine with Flink or Spark Streaming for real‑time ETL.

Vector search services – Milvus supports distributed, replicated vector storage and is suitable for AI search; monitor index build performance and resource allocation
db-engines.com
.

Observability stacks – Prometheus combined with VictoriaMetrics/Thanos/Loki forms a cloud‑native stack, offering synchronous replication and long‑term retention; ideal for Kubernetes clusters.

Conclusion

For DevOps and architects, database selection must consider not only performance but also high availability, automated failover, scaling strategies and operational overhead. Some systems (e.g., open‑source InfluxDB) lack built‑in replication and require commercial licensing
db-engines.com
, while managed services or Kubernetes Operators can significantly reduce operational burden. In summary:

Critical workloads favour systems with strong consistency and integrated HA (NewSQL or enhanced relational solutions).

Caching & streaming benefit from lightweight deployments such as Redis or Kafka, with careful configuration of replicas and monitoring.

Analytical & time‑series workloads must balance performance against ops cost; ClickHouse and VictoriaMetrics scale well but demand attentive monitoring and backup.

DevOps teams can leverage Kubernetes operators, automation tools and observability suites (Grafana, Prometheus, ELK) to build reliable and scalable database infrastructure.
