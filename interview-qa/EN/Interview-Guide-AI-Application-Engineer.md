Interview Prep Notes — AI LLM Application Engineer / AI Agent Developer

1. Role Definition
AI LLM Application Engineer

Focuses on applying large language models (LLMs) to real-world use cases.

Calling LLM APIs (ChatGPT, Claude, Ollama, on-prem LLaMA)

Building RAG systems (vector DB + retrieval-augmented generation)

Prompt engineering, model evaluation & fine-tuning

Backend & frontend integration (APIs + web apps)

AI Agent Developer

Develops AI agents with autonomy, tool usage, and memory capabilities.

Using frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, MetaGPT)

Integrating external tools (search, DB, APIs)

Designing memory (short/long-term, knowledge bases)

Multi-agent collaboration & complex task automation

2. Skills

Core: Python, Go/JavaScript (nice-to-have), FastAPI, Next.js, Docker, Kubernetes

AI Stack: HuggingFace, OpenAI API, Ollama, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vector DBs (pgvector/Milvus/Weaviate), Prompt engineering, LoRA fine-tuning

Agent Stack: LangChain Agents, AutoGen, CrewAI, ReAct, Tree-of-Thoughts, Redis Memory, pgvector

3. Learning Path (90 days)

Phase 1: Basics → Project: Chatbot API

Phase 2: RAG Applications → Project: Enterprise Knowledge QA

Phase 3: Agent Development → Project: AI Agent Assistant

4. Portfolio Projects

Enterprise Knowledge QA (LangChain + pgvector + FastAPI + Next.js)

AI Assistant (LangChain Agents + Redis Memory + API Integration)

LLM Fine-tuning & Deployment (HuggingFace + LoRA + MLflow + K8s)

5. Common Interview Questions

Q: What is the principle of RAG?
RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation, enriches prompts with retrieved context, improving accuracy & reliability.

Q: Difference between Agent and Chatbot?
Chatbots only converse; Agents perceive → reason → act → remember, capable of executing tasks.

Q: How do you optimize LLM inference?
Techniques: quantization (4bit/8bit), pruning, TensorRT/ONNX acceleration, batching, caching.
