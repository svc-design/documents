<h1 id="interview-qa-guide">Interview QA Guide</h1>
<p>This guide aggregates interview materials across operations, DevOps,
observability, and AI Ops domains.</p>
<h2 id="self-introduction-context">Self-Introduction Context</h2>
<p>Hello, I’m Haitao Pan. I have 14 years of experience in IT, having
supported organizations in manufacturing, finance, telecommunications,
and the internet sector. My core skills center on Linux/Kubernetes,
Terraform/Ansible, Docker, and DevOps, with long-term focus on
observability and performance tuning.</p>
<p>My background: 1. Started at CS2C, working on Linux porting and RPM
automation. 2. Scaled operations and automation at Inspur and Knownsec;
contributed to Deepin/UnionTech on productizing Deepin Server. 3. After
moving into cloud-native, delivered a banking container platform at
Alauda and led cloud and hybrid-cloud solutions at UCloud. 4.
Implemented Terraform + GitOps + Datadog for Roche at HighSun; at Tesla
Shanghai, standardized SRE practices around CI/CD and application
operations. 5. Most recently at Yunshan Networks, focused on NPM/APM,
eBPF, and Kubernetes performance troubleshooting for customers.</p>
<p>My career path follows “Linux foundations → Containers/Public Cloud →
Enterprise IaC/DevOps → Full-stack Observability.” I currently
concentrate on LLM-Ops: blending observability data with RAG and AI
Agents to build reliability-focused automation loops that help teams
deliver faster and more reliably.</p>
<p>(Alternative 20-second elevator pitch) 14 years in IT:
Linux/K8s/IaC/DevOps leading into observability. Experience spans
Deepin, Alauda, UCloud, Roche projects, Tesla SRE, and Yunshan customer
support. Now focused on LLM-Ops, connecting RAG/Agents with
observability systems to create faster, more stable automated
operations.</p>
<h2 id="responding-to-recent-layoffs">Responding to Recent Layoffs</h2>
<p>My recent role changes stemmed from organizational optimization and
project downsizing that led to platform roles being merged or
eliminated; they were unrelated to performance. I consistently closed
out delivery and handover work. Now I’m focused on the value I can bring
immediately to your Kubernetes/IaC/observability platform. I’ve already
fully answered this topic, and it had nothing to do with performance. If
there are no other questions about role fit, I suggest we move on to my
project experience to assess alignment with your needs.</p>
<p>English quick response (for multinational or returnee interviews)</p>
<p>Polite and firm:</p>
<p>I’ve fully addressed the reason—it was organizational restructuring
and platform consolidation, not performance. If there are no further
fit-related questions, I suggest we move to my project track record and
see how it maps to your needs.</p>
<h1 id="knowledge-map">Knowledge Map</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This series focuses on the core technical areas of Site Reliability

automation, and DevOps practices. It covers open-ended problem-solving
skills, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform/Ansible/Helm, modern
CI/CD and GitOps workflows (GitHub Actions + ArgoCD), observability
stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK), and troubleshooting in Linux,
Kubernetes, and public cloud platforms (AWS/Azure).</p>
<h2 id="linux-commands-k8s-troubleshooting">Linux commands &amp;&amp;
K8s troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="linux-system-topic">Linux System topic</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Combining grep, sed, awk, and cut <em>What:</em> Classic Linux
text-processing utilities that parse and transform structured or
semi-structured data. <em>How:</em> Pipe commands so that
<code>grep</code> filters lines, <code>awk</code> extracts or computes
fields, <code>sed</code> rewrites text, and <code>cut</code> trims
columns. <em>Example:</em>
<code>grep ERROR app.log | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/://g' | cut -d',' -f1</code>
isolates the failing component name from log entries.</p></li>
<li><p>HTTP error codes and causes <em>What:</em> Standardized status
codes that describe request outcomes between clients and servers.
<em>How:</em> Map each code family (4xx client issues, 5xx server
faults) to remediation steps such as checking routing rules, backend
health, or permissions. <em>Example:</em> When a deployment surfaced
repeated 502 errors, I validated the load balancer health checks and
discovered a crashed upstream pod.</p></li>
<li><p>Long connection, short connection, and WebSocket <em>What:</em>
Different communication patterns for TCP-based services. <em>How:</em>
Use persistent long connections for stateful or chatty backends, short
connections for stateless REST calls, and WebSockets for bidirectional
real-time updates. <em>Example:</em> A trading dashboard kept a
WebSocket open to stream live quotes, while its REST API used
short-lived HTTPS calls for order submissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Nginx performance optimization methods <em>What:</em> Tunable
parameters and modules that improve throughput and latency.
<em>How:</em> Adjust worker counts, enable caching and compression,
reuse upstream connections, and profile slow upstreams.
<em>Example:</em> Increasing <code>worker_connections</code> and
enabling <code>proxy_cache</code> cut our API gateway latency by 30%
under load testing.</p></li>
<li><p>LVS vs. Nginx vs. HAProxy <em>What:</em> Common load-balancing
technologies across layers 4 and 7. <em>How:</em> Select LVS for
ultra-high L4 throughput, Nginx for HTTP-aware routing, and HAProxy when
you need mixed L4/L7 features with rich health checks. <em>Example:</em>
We placed LVS at the edge for TCP fan-out, then HAProxy in front of
microservices to route traffic based on HTTP headers.</p></li>
<li><p>Zombie process definition and handling <em>What:</em> A child
process that finished but whose exit status was never reaped by its
parent. <em>How:</em> Monitor processes stuck in state <code>Z</code>,
send signals to the parent, or adopt them with <code>init</code> by
terminating the parent if needed. <em>Example:</em> After spotting
zombies with <code>ps aux | grep Z</code>, we patched the supervisor to
call <code>waitpid()</code> after each worker exit.</p></li>
<li><p>Process, thread, and coroutine differences <em>What:</em>
Execution units with varying isolation and scheduling. <em>How:</em> Use
OS-managed processes for isolation, threads for shared-memory
parallelism, and coroutines for cooperative concurrency within a thread.
<em>Example:</em> In a scraping tool we ran multiple processes for site
isolation, threads for I/O concurrency, and coroutines in Python’s
asyncio for non-blocking requests.</p></li>
<li><p>Nginx asynchronous non-blocking mode <em>What:</em> Event-driven
architecture that handles many connections with minimal threads.
<em>How:</em> Leverage the <code>epoll</code> loop so each worker
processes I/O readiness events instead of blocking on sockets.
<em>Example:</em> Switching a blocking upstream module to the async
upstream API allowed one worker to handle thousands of keepalive
connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Troubleshooting network packet loss in Linux <em>What:</em>
Systematic approach to locate the failing hop or component.
<em>How:</em> Start with <code>ping</code> and <code>traceroute</code>,
inspect interface counters via <code>ip -s link</code>, and capture
traffic with <code>tcpdump</code> for deeper analysis. <em>Example:</em>
We traced intermittent loss to CRC errors on a NIC, confirmed with
<code>ethtool -S eth0</code>, and replaced the faulty cable.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance analysis and diagnostic commands <em>What:</em>
Tooling to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. <em>How:</em>
Combine utilities like <code>top</code>, <code>vmstat</code>,
<code>iostat</code>, <code>sar</code>, <code>strace</code>, and
<code>lsof</code> based on the suspected bottleneck. <em>Example:</em>
When disk latency spiked, <code>iostat -xz 1</code> revealed a single
partition with near-100% utilization caused by a runaway backup
job.</p></li>
<li><p>Process interruption, soft interrupt, hard interrupt
<em>What:</em> Mechanisms that preempt CPU execution to handle events.
<em>How:</em> Understand that software interrupts (softirqs) handle
kernel-level tasks like networking, while hardware interrupts respond to
device signals. <em>Example:</em> High softirq CPU in <code>top</code>
indicated heavy packet processing, leading us to tune the network stack
with RSS queues.</p></li>
<li><p>Uninterruptible process state <em>What:</em> Processes waiting on
critical I/O that cannot be killed until the operation completes.
<em>How:</em> Identify state <code>D</code> in <code>ps</code> or
<code>top</code>, investigate underlying I/O, and resolve the hardware
or filesystem issue. <em>Example:</em> A blocked NFS mount left
processes in <code>D</code>; remounting the hung volume freed them
immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack memory vs. heap memory <em>What:</em> Memory regions with
different lifetime and allocation strategies. <em>How:</em> Use stack
for automatic, small allocations and heap for dynamic, long-lived data;
monitor with profiling tools to avoid overflows or leaks.
<em>Example:</em> Refactoring a recursive function to iterative reduced
stack usage and prevented stack overflow during large batch
jobs.</p></li>
<li><p>Process states in the <code>top</code> command <em>What:</em>
Indicators of current execution status. <em>How:</em> Interpret
<code>R</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>Z</code>, and
<code>T</code> to prioritize investigation of running, sleeping,
blocked, zombie, or stopped processes. <em>Example:</em> Spotting many
<code>D</code> states hinted at storage latency, which we confirmed with
<code>iostat</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Purpose of <code>/proc</code> <em>What:</em> Virtual filesystem
exposing kernel and process metadata. <em>How:</em> Read files like
<code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>, <code>/proc/meminfo</code>, or
<code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd</code> for troubleshooting. <em>Example:</em>
Checking <code>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</code> quickly confirmed
whether packet forwarding was enabled on a router node.</p></li>
<li><p>Load vs. CPU usage <em>What:</em> Different metrics describing
system demand. <em>How:</em> Use load average to view runnable and
waiting processes, and CPU usage for the proportion of active CPU time;
correlate both when diagnosing issues. <em>Example:</em> A high load
average with modest CPU usage revealed many processes waiting on disk
I/O rather than CPU saturation.</p></li>
<li><p>MAC to IP resolution <em>What:</em> Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP) that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses in local networks.
<em>How:</em> Inspect <code>arp -n</code> tables, send gratuitous ARP,
or use <code>ip neigh</code> to validate entries. <em>Example:</em>
Clearing a stale ARP cache with <code>ip neigh flush</code> restored
connectivity after a failover.</p></li>
<li><p>RAID types and use cases <em>What:</em> Redundant array
configurations balancing performance and resilience. <em>How:</em>
Choose RAID0 for speed, RAID1 for mirroring, RAID5 for parity-based
balance, and RAID10 for high performance plus redundancy.
<em>Example:</em> For a database requiring fast writes and redundancy,
we provisioned RAID10 on SSDs.</p></li>
<li><p>Partitioning with LVM <em>What:</em> Logical Volume Manager for
flexible disk management. <em>How:</em> Create physical volumes with
<code>pvcreate</code>, group them with <code>vgcreate</code>, then carve
logical volumes via <code>lvcreate</code> before formatting and
mounting. <em>Example:</em> Expanding <code>/var</code> involved adding
a new disk, extending the volume group, and resizing the logical volume
without downtime.</p></li>
<li><p>Viewing and optimizing JVM memory <em>What:</em> Tools and flags
to monitor and tune Java heap usage. <em>How:</em> Use
<code>jstat</code>, <code>jmap</code>, or VisualVM for telemetry, then
adjust parameters like <code>-Xms</code>, <code>-Xmx</code>, and GC
options. <em>Example:</em> Setting <code>-Xmx4g</code> and enabling G1GC
stabilized latency for a Spring service under peak load.</p></li>
<li><p>Managing kernel parameters <em>What:</em> System-wide tunables
affecting networking, memory, and more. <em>How:</em> Query or set
values with <code>sysctl</code>, persist changes in
<code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>, and reload with <code>sysctl -p</code>.
<em>Example:</em> Raising <code>net.core.somaxconn</code> via sysctl
prevented SYN backlog drops during traffic spikes.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjusting process limits, max threads, open files <em>What:</em>
ulimit and PAM configurations that control resource ceilings.
<em>How:</em> Edit <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code> for user-level
limits and <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> for system-wide thread counts,
then relogin or reload. <em>Example:</em> Increasing <code>nofile</code>
to 65535 fixed connection errors for a high-concurrency Nginx
instance.</p></li>
<li><p><code>du</code> vs. <code>df</code> discrepancies <em>What:</em>
Different perspectives on disk usage. <em>How:</em> Use <code>du</code>
for file-level space, <code>df</code> for filesystem availability;
investigate deleted-but-open files or reserved space when numbers
diverge. <em>Example:</em> Restarting a log collector released deleted
log files that kept disk usage high despite <code>du</code> showing
little data.</p></li>
<li><p>Buffers vs. cached memory <em>What:</em> Kernel memory used for
block device I/O versus filesystem data caching. <em>How:</em> Interpret
<code>free -m</code> output to distinguish buffer usage from page cache,
reclaiming memory if needed. <em>Example:</em> After flushing caches
with <code>sync; echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</code>, cached
memory dropped while buffers remained for ongoing writes.</p></li>
<li><p><code>lsof</code> use cases <em>What:</em> Utility for listing
open files and network sockets. <em>How:</em> Run <code>lsof -i</code>
for listening ports, <code>lsof +L1</code> to find deleted-but-open
files, or <code>lsof -p &lt;pid&gt;</code> for descriptors of a process.
<em>Example:</em> Identifying which process held port 8080 let us safely
restart the correct service.</p></li>
<li><p>Inter-process communication methods <em>What:</em> Mechanisms
like pipes, message queues, signals, shared memory, and sockets.
<em>How:</em> Select the method that fits data volume, latency, and
topology requirements. <em>Example:</em> We used shared memory for a
high-frequency trading feed, complemented by POSIX semaphores to
coordinate writers and readers.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting process priority <em>What:</em> Controls that influence
CPU scheduling via niceness. <em>How:</em> Launch processes with
<code>nice -n &lt;value&gt;</code> or adjust live processes with
<code>renice</code> to raise or lower their priority. <em>Example:</em>
Temporarily lowering a batch job’s priority using
<code>renice 15 &lt;pid&gt;</code> protected critical web workloads
during peak hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory paging vs. segmentation <em>What:</em> Memory-management
strategies. <em>How:</em> Understand paging’s fixed-size pages versus
segmentation’s logical divisions to interpret kernel tuning and
performance impacts. <em>Example:</em> Enabling hugepages for a database
minimized TLB misses compared to default paging.</p></li>
<li><p>Custom systemd services <em>What:</em> Service units describing
how daemons start and stop. <em>How:</em> Create a <code>.service</code>
file in <code>/etc/systemd/system</code>, define <code>ExecStart</code>,
reload systemd, then enable and start the service. <em>Example:</em> We
packaged a log forwarder as <code>log-forwarder.service</code> to manage
restarts and dependencies automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>Kernel module management <em>What:</em> Loadable components that
extend kernel functionality. <em>How:</em> Use <code>modprobe</code> to
load modules with dependencies, <code>lsmod</code> to verify, and
<code>rmmod</code> to unload when safe. <em>Example:</em> Loading
<code>ip_vs</code> modules enabled LVS functionality on new load
balancer nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Ansible roles <em>What:</em> Reusable configuration units for
complex automation. <em>How:</em> Structure roles with tasks, handlers,
defaults, and templates, then compose them in playbooks.
<em>Example:</em> A Kubernetes bootstrap playbook reused roles for
installing container runtime, kubeadm init, and worker joins across
dozens of nodes.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Understanding of Kubernetes <em>What:</em> Kubernetes is an
open-source orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized workloads. <em>How:</em> Leverage
declarative manifests, controllers, and reconciliation loops to keep
desired and actual state aligned. <em>Example:</em> Defining a
Deployment for a web API let Kubernetes roll out updates with zero
downtime using rolling updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Kubernetes cluster architecture <em>What:</em> Core control-plane
components and node agents that coordinate scheduling and workload
execution. <em>How:</em> Describe the API server, etcd, controller
manager, scheduler, kubelet, and kube-proxy, plus worker nodes hosting
pods. <em>Example:</em> During an audit I diagrammed how managed masters
in EKS interact with our worker groups and load balancers.</p></li>
<li><p>Pod creation process <em>What:</em> Sequence from user request to
running containers. <em>How:</em> A manifest hits the API server, gets
stored in etcd, controllers create ReplicaSets, and the scheduler binds
pods to nodes where kubelet pulls images and starts containers.
<em>Example:</em> Reviewing events with
<code>kubectl describe pod</code> showed scheduling delays due to
insufficient node memory, guiding us to scale the node group.</p></li>
<li><p>Pod deletion process <em>What:</em> Graceful termination flow
when removing workloads. <em>How:</em> Kubernetes sends a termination
signal, honors <code>terminationGracePeriodSeconds</code>, executes
preStop hooks, and kubelet removes the pod after containers exit.
<em>Example:</em> Setting a 60-second grace period allowed our Nginx
pods to drain connections before the load balancer deregistered
them.</p></li>

</table>
<p><strong>Q: Which AWS services do you use most often?</strong>
<em>What:</em> Core building blocks across compute, storage, database,
identity, and monitoring. <em>How:</em> Combine EC2 or EKS for
workloads, store assets in S3, manage data with RDS, protect access via
IAM, and observe health through CloudWatch. <em>Example:</em> A
production microservice stack ran on EKS with pods pulling configuration
from S3, RDS for persistence, IAM roles for service accounts, and
CloudWatch dashboards tracking latency.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How would you design a highly available three-tier
architecture on AWS?</strong> <em>What:</em> A resilient web,
application, and database topology across availability zones.
<em>How:</em> Place web tier instances behind an ALB, run autoscaled
containers on EKS/ECS, replicate databases with RDS Multi-AZ or Aurora
read replicas, and front everything with CloudFront plus monitoring and
security services. <em>Example:</em> For an e-commerce site we deployed
ALB-backed EKS pods across three AZs, used Aurora with an async replica,
cached static assets with CloudFront, and wired GuardDuty alerts into
Slack.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-as-code-and-automation">Infrastructure as Code
and Automation</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How do you manage AWS resources with Terraform?</strong>
<em>What:</em> Declarative IaC to provision and version infrastructure.
<em>How:</em> Break environments into reusable modules, store state in
S3 with DynamoDB locking, and gate changes through PR-triggered
<code>terraform plan</code> and <code>apply</code> workflows.
<em>Example:</em> A network module built VPC, subnets, and security
groups; GitHub Actions ran <code>plan</code> on pull requests and
applied after approval, giving us auditable changes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you compare Terraform with CloudFormation?</strong>
<em>What:</em> Two popular IaC solutions for AWS. <em>How:</em> Favor
Terraform for multi-cloud flexibility and community modules, while
choosing CloudFormation for AWS-native features and tighter service
integration. <em>Example:</em> We used Terraform to manage shared
services across AWS and GCP, but relied on CloudFormation StackSets to
roll out GuardDuty organization-wide.</p>
<h3 id="cicd">CI/CD</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How do you design CI pipelines with GitHub
Actions?</strong> <em>What:</em> Automated checks that validate and
package code. <em>How:</em> Define workflows that lint, run unit tests,
build container images, leverage caching, and push to ECR with matrix
testing where needed. <em>Example:</em> The main branch workflow linted
Python code, executed pytest across Python versions 3.9 and 3.11, then
built and pushed an image to ECR using cached dependencies to shorten
runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you implement CD with ArgoCD?</strong>
<em>What:</em> GitOps-based continuous delivery to Kubernetes.
<em>How:</em> Point ArgoCD at Helm charts or manifests in Git, enable
auto-sync with health checks, and integrate Argo Rollouts for
progressive delivery. <em>Example:</em> Updating a canary Service
manifest triggered ArgoCD to sync, run analysis via Argo Rollouts, and
automatically promote the release after success metrics passed.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-and-operations">Monitoring and Operations</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How do you monitor CI/CD pipelines?</strong>
<em>What:</em> Visibility into build and deploy health. <em>How:</em>
Send GitHub Actions status to chat channels, expose ArgoCD sync metrics
to Prometheus, alert via Alertmanager, and visualize latency/error
budgets in Grafana. <em>Example:</em> A Slack webhook posted failed
builds instantly, while Grafana panels highlighted ArgoCD sync errors
that signaled drift in staging clusters.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Have you faced Terraform or CI/CD failures? How did you
handle them?</strong> <em>Situation:</em> <code>terraform apply</code>
failed during a networking change. <em>Task:</em> Restore pipeline
stability without risking production. <em>Action:</em> Ran
<code>terraform plan</code> to inspect drift, isolated the misconfigured
security group, and reverted via version control while notifying
stakeholders. <em>Result:</em> The pipeline recovered on the next run,
and we added a pre-merge validation step to catch similar errors
earlier.</p>
<h3 id="behavioral">Behavioral</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How would you handle conflicts between Dev and SRE
teams?</strong> <em>Situation:</em> Development pushed for rapid feature
rollout while SRE flagged reliability risks. <em>Task:</em> Align both
teams on a data-driven decision. <em>Action:</em> Facilitated a session
to review SLOs, error rates, and cost implications, then proposed a
phased canary rollout with extra monitoring. <em>Result:</em> Both teams
agreed to the compromise, the rollout succeeded without incidents, and
trust between teams improved.</p>
<p>⚡ Tips: - Use <strong>What → How → Example</strong> for technical
answers. - Apply the <strong>STAR method</strong> for behavioral
questions. - Keep English responses clear, concise, and confident.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h2>
<h3 id="metrics-eventslogs-tracing-and-profiling">1. Metrics,
Events/Logs, Tracing, and Profiling</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> The four pillars of observability describe
quantitative signals (metrics), discrete records (logs/events), request
lifecycles (traces), and runtime resource usage (profiling).
<em>How:</em> Collect metrics for trend monitoring, centralize
logs/events for forensics, instrument services with distributed tracing,
and profile hot paths during performance tuning. <em>Example:</em> A
checkout outage was diagnosed by correlating elevated HTTP 500 metrics,
error logs pointing to a downstream timeout, a trace showing the slow
dependency, and CPU profiling confirming thread contention.</p>
<h3 id="metrics-fundamentals">2. Metrics Fundamentals</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Time-series measurements of system and application
health. <em>How:</em> Track resource usage, latency, error rates, and
saturation; set appropriate scrape intervals and retention policies to
balance fidelity with cost. <em>Example:</em> We sampled API latency
every 15 seconds, stored 30 days locally, and downsampled into long-term
object storage for quarterly trend reviews.</p>
<h3 id="log-management">3. Log Management</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Structured or unstructured event records describing
system state changes. <em>How:</em> Aggregate application, system, and
container logs into ELK/Loki, enrich with metadata, and apply retention
plus index optimization to manage volume. <em>Example:</em> Shipping
Kubernetes pod logs via Fluent Bit into Loki let us filter by namespace
and quickly trace a crash-looping deployment.</p>
<h3 id="event-handling">4. Event Handling</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Notifications about important state changes such as
pod lifecycle events. <em>How:</em> Consume events through watchers or
webhooks, trigger automated responses, and store critical events for
correlation with incidents. <em>Example:</em> A controller listened for
FailedMount events and automatically triggered remediation by
reattaching the correct persistent volume.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-tracing">5. Distributed Tracing</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> End-to-end visibility across service call chains.

<code>sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))</code> alerted
us to error surges aggregated across all pods.</p>
<h3 id="thanos-architecture">15. Thanos Architecture</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> A Prometheus extension for long-term storage and
global querying. <em>How:</em> Deploy sidecars to upload TSDB blocks to
object storage, run Store, Query, Compactor, and Ruler components for
aggregation and rule evaluation. <em>Example:</em> Thanos Query let us
view metrics across three regions, while Compactor reduced storage costs
by downsampling historical data.</p>
<h3 id="thanos-vs.-victoriametrics">16. Thanos vs. VictoriaMetrics</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Alternative approaches to scalable time-series
storage. <em>How:</em> Choose Thanos to extend existing Prometheus
setups with object storage, or VictoriaMetrics as a standalone
high-performance TSDB compatible with Prometheus protocols.
<em>Example:</em> A greenfield observability stack adopted

without local Prometheus instances.</p>
<h3 id="thanos-rule-component-vs.-prometheus-rules">18. Thanos Rule
Component vs. Prometheus Rules</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Distributed rule evaluation versus local-only rules.
<em>How:</em> Run Thanos Ruler to execute cross-cluster rules and store
results centrally, while Prometheus evaluates rules limited to its own
data. <em>Example:</em> A global error budget rule ran in Thanos Ruler
to combine metrics from multiple regions, providing a single alert for
SRE on-call.</p>
<h3 id="prometheus-alert-behavior">19. Prometheus Alert Behavior</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Factors influencing alert latency and noise.
<em>How:</em> Tune scrape intervals, rule evaluation timings, and
Alertmanager suppression/inhibition to reduce duplicates and ensure
timely delivery. <em>Example:</em> Increasing the evaluation interval
from 1m to 30s cut detection delay, while Alertmanager inhibition
prevented simultaneous alerts for parent and child services.</p>
<h3 id="pod-memory-metrics">20. Pod Memory Metrics</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Working Set Size (WSS) and Resident Set Size (RSS)
capture container memory usage. <em>How:</em> Use WSS to gauge actively
used memory and RSS for physical footprint; cross-reference with cgroup
limits to prevent evictions. <em>Example:</em> A pod with WSS near its
limit triggered proactive scaling before kubelet OOMKilled it.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-optimization">21. Monitoring Optimization</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Focus on golden signals—latency, traffic, errors,
saturation—and ensure Prometheus performs efficiently. <em>How:</em>
Partition scrape targets, shard Prometheus when needed, optimize PromQL

action for auditing.</p>
<h3 id="data-compression-and-persistence">23. Data Compression and
Persistence</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Prometheus TSDB stores blocks using compression
algorithms like Gorilla for efficiency. <em>How:</em> Rely on block
compaction and retention policies, and extend with Thanos or Cortex for
long-term archival. <em>Example:</em> Weekly compaction reduced storage
footprint by 40%, and offloading blocks older than 15 days to S3 kept
local disks under capacity.</p>
<h3 id="kubectl-top-vs.-free">24. <code>kubectl top</code>
vs. <code>free</code></h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Different scopes for resource reporting. <em>How:</em>
Interpret <code>kubectl top</code> as cgroup-scoped container metrics
and <code>free</code> as node-level memory, accounting for caches and
kubelet overhead. <em>Example:</em> Investigating discrepancies revealed
page cache usage on the node, so we tuned eviction thresholds instead of
resizing pods.</p>
<h3 id="exporters-and-troubleshooting">25. Exporters and
Troubleshooting</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Components exposing metrics for Prometheus scraping.
<em>How:</em> Deploy Node, Blackbox, and Redis exporters with health

through Pushgateway because they terminated too quickly for direct
scraping.</p>
<h3 id="prometheus-operator">28. Prometheus Operator</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Kubernetes operator that manages Prometheus,
Alertmanager, and associated resources via CRDs. <em>How:</em> Define
ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, and PrometheusRule objects to add scrape
targets and alerting rules declaratively. <em>Example:</em> Adding a new
microservice involved creating a ServiceMonitor manifest; the operator
handled reloading Prometheus automatically.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-external-targets">29. Monitoring External
Targets</h3>
<p><em>What:</em> Collecting metrics from systems outside Kubernetes.
<em>How:</em> Configure additional scrape jobs in Prometheus or expose

ingestion spikes.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure-as-code-iac-interview-guide">Infrastructure as
Code (IaC) Interview Guide</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Definition of Infrastructure as Code <em>What:</em> IaC treats
infrastructure configuration as version-controlled source code.
<em>How:</em> Use declarative or imperative templates to define
resources, manage them via pipelines, and enforce reviews plus automated
testing. <em>Example:</em> Terraform modules describe VPCs and ECS
clusters, and a GitOps workflow applies changes after peer
approval.</p></li>
<li><p>Declarative vs. Imperative IaC <em>What:</em> Declarative defines
desired state; imperative lists exact commands. <em>How:</em> Choose
declarative tools (Terraform, CloudFormation) for idempotent
environments and imperative scripts (Ansible shell tasks) when
step-by-step control is required. <em>Example:</em> Terraform declared a
Kubernetes cluster configuration, while an Ansible playbook imperatively
rotated TLS certificates during migration.</p></li>
<li><p>Module and Reuse Strategy <em>What:</em> Modularization packages
repeatable infrastructure patterns. <em>How:</em> Structure Terraform
modules or CloudFormation nested stacks with inputs/outputs and semantic
versioning, and publish them to internal registries. <em>Example:</em> A
shared VPC module accepted CIDR blocks and tags, enabling multiple teams
to instantiate networks with consistent guardrails.</p></li>
<li><p>State Management <em>What:</em> IaC tools need to track current
resource state. <em>How:</em> Store Terraform state in remote backends
(S3 + DynamoDB locking), use state locking, and run drift detection
regularly. <em>Example:</em> Enabling DynamoDB locking prevented two
engineers from applying conflicting changes simultaneously.</p></li>
<li><p>Environment Promotion Strategy <em>What:</em> Process to move
infrastructure changes from dev to prod. <em>How:</em> Maintain separate
workspaces or stacks per environment, validate with automated tests, and
promote via pull requests. <em>Example:</em> A Terraform plan applied to
staging first; once approved, the same module version and variables were
promoted to production.</p></li>
<li><p>Policy and Compliance <em>What:</em> Guardrails to ensure
infrastructure adheres to standards. <em>How:</em> Use policy-as-code
tools like Terraform Cloud Policy Sets, OPA, or AWS Config to enforce
tagging, encryption, and network rules. <em>Example:</em> A Sentinel
policy blocked any Terraform plan lacking required cost-center tags,
reducing billing surprises.</p></li>
<li><p>Testing Infrastructure Code <em>What:</em> Validation techniques
for templates and modules. <em>How:</em> Run syntax checks
(<code>terraform validate</code>), unit tests with Terratest or Kitchen,
and integration tests post-deploy. <em>Example:</em> Terratest spun up a
temporary module deployment, asserted that security groups blocked
unwanted ports, then destroyed the resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Secrets Management <em>What:</em> Handling sensitive data within
IaC workflows. <em>How:</em> Integrate with secret stores (AWS Secrets
Manager, Vault), use encrypted variables, and avoid committing secrets
to repos. <em>Example:</em> Terraform pulled database passwords from
Vault via dynamic credentials, eliminating hardcoded secrets.</p></li>
<li><p>Drift Detection and Remediation <em>What:</em> Identifying
differences between declared and actual infrastructure. <em>How:</em>
Schedule <code>terraform plan</code> in read-only mode or use tools like
AWS Config Drift Detection; reconcile by updating code or importing
manual changes. <em>Example:</em> A nightly plan detected manual IAM
edits; we codified the change and enforced automation to prevent
recurrence.</p></li>
<li><p>Blue-Green and Canary Infrastructure Changes <em>What:</em> Safe
rollout patterns for critical infrastructure updates. <em>How:</em>
Duplicate resources (blue/green) or gradually shift traffic (canary)
with load balancers and DNS, using IaC to coordinate. <em>Example:</em>
Provisioning a new Aurora cluster in parallel let us cut over via Route
53 weighted records with minimal downtime.</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-Cloud Considerations <em>What:</em> Managing resources
across providers. <em>How:</em> Abstract common patterns into modules,
parameterize provider blocks, and centralize logging plus tagging across
clouds. <em>Example:</em> A shared Terraform module created Kubernetes
clusters in both AWS (EKS) and GCP (GKE) using provider
aliases.</p></li>
<li><p>IaC Security <em>What:</em> Protecting pipelines and artifacts.
<em>How:</em> Restrict credentials, rotate access keys, sign state files
or templates, and audit pipeline actions. <em>Example:</em> CI runners
used short-lived AWS STS tokens obtained via OIDC, eliminating static
credentials in build systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Handling Breaking Changes <em>What:</em> Managing disruptive
updates like resource recreation. <em>How:</em> Review plans for
<code>destroy</code> actions, use <code>lifecycle</code> blocks to
prevent accidental replacement, and schedule maintenance windows.
<em>Example:</em> When Terraform planned to recreate an RDS instance, we
set <code>prevent_destroy = true</code> and performed a controlled
migration instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboration and Code Review <em>What:</em> Team processes for
IaC changes. <em>How:</em> Require pull requests, peer reviews, and
automated linting (<code>tflint</code>, <code>checkov</code>), and
document module usage. <em>Example:</em> A PR checklist ensured plans
were attached, tagging standards met, and reviewers from platform and
security signed off.</p></li>
<li><p>Disaster Recovery with IaC <em>What:</em> Rebuilding
infrastructure rapidly after failures. <em>How:</em> Maintain versioned
templates, automated backups of state, and run periodic game days to
rehearse redeployment. <em>Example:</em> During a DR drill we restored a
VPC, ALB, and ECS services in a new region using the same Terraform
modules within 45 minutes.</p></li>

caching Python wheels avoided repeated downloads.</p></li>
<li><p>Blue-Green, Gray, and Canary Releases Across Clusters
<em>What:</em> Progressive delivery strategies for multi-cluster
deployments. <em>How:</em> Maintain blue/green environments for instant
traffic switchovers, roll out gray releases by gradually expanding user
cohorts, and run canary releases by routing a small traffic percentage
before scaling up. <em>Example:</em> A payment service promoted updates
cluster by cluster using canary weights in Istio, observing metrics
before executing the global blue-to-green cutover.</p></li>
<li><p>Shift-Left Testing <em>What:</em> Moving testing earlier in the
development lifecycle. <em>How:</em> Embed unit, integration, and
security tests in CI pipelines triggered on pull requests, and provide
developers with local environments mirroring production.
<em>Example:</em> Running API contract tests during pre-merge checks
caught schema regressions before they reached staging, reducing
rework.</p></li>
<li><p>GitOps Fundamentals <em>What:</em> Operating model that stores
desired infrastructure and application state in Git. <em>How:</em> Use
Git repositories as the source of truth, reconcile actual state via
agents like Argo CD or Flux, and manage changes through pull requests.
<em>Example:</em> A cluster configuration repo triggered Argo CD
auto-sync; merging a PR updated ConfigMaps and Deployments within
minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Backing Up GitLab Repositories <em>What:</em> Ensuring source
code durability. <em>How:</em> Schedule GitLab backups, mirror
repositories to secondary remotes, and script database plus artifact
snapshots. <em>Example:</em> Nightly <code>gitlab-backup create</code>

<li><p>Jenkins User Permission Management <em>What:</em> Controlling
access within Jenkins. <em>How:</em> Configure role-based access
plugins, assign global vs. project-level permissions, and audit user
actions regularly. <em>Example:</em> Creating a read-only viewer role
let QA teams inspect pipeline status without risking job configuration
changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Jenkins Pipeline Modes <em>What:</em> Declarative and scripted
pipeline syntaxes. <em>How:</em> Use declarative syntax for standardized
stages and scripted pipelines for advanced logic when needed.
<em>Example:</em> A declarative pipeline handled typical build/test
steps, while a scripted block iterated through dynamic microservice
lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Jenkins High Availability <em>What:</em> Architecture to minimize
downtime. <em>How:</em> Deploy redundant masters with shared state or
operate an active/passive setup, distribute agents, load balance inbound
requests, and back up <code>JENKINS_HOME</code>. <em>Example:</em>
Placing Jenkins masters behind an HAProxy VIP enabled seamless failover
during maintenance windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Master-Agent Coordination <em>What:</em> Division of
responsibilities between Jenkins controller and agents. <em>How:</em>

CI/CD. <em>How:</em> Define stages for compile, test, security scan,
package, and deploy, with parallelized steps and gated approvals.
<em>Example:</em> A pipeline ran unit tests and SAST in parallel before
requiring manual approval to deploy to production.</p></li>
<li><p>Argo Rollouts Strategies <em>What:</em> Progressive delivery
mechanisms within Kubernetes. <em>How:</em> Configure blue-green
strategies with separate services, or define canary steps adjusting
traffic weights and analysis templates. <em>Example:</em> Argo Rollouts
gradually shifted 5%, 25%, 50%, then 100% of traffic to a new API while
monitoring Prometheus metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>Argo CD Application CRD <em>What:</em> Custom resource that
defines a Git-tracked application target. <em>How:</em> Specify repo
URL, revision, destination cluster, namespace, and sync policies in the
Application manifest. <em>Example:</em> Updating the Application CRD to
include a Helm value override deployed a new feature flag
automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>Auto-Sync vs. Manual Sync in Argo CD <em>What:</em> Deployment
control modes. <em>How:</em> Enable auto-sync for rapid reconciliation
or require manual sync to gate changes via UI/CLI approvals.
<em>Example:</em> Production apps used manual sync with change windows,
while dev clusters auto-synced on merge to main.</p></li>
<li><p>Argo CD Troubleshooting <em>What:</em> Steps to diagnose sync
issues. <em>How:</em> Inspect application events, review pod logs,
compare live vs. desired manifests, and adjust sync options like pruning
or self-heal. <em>Example:</em> Resolving a sync error involved fixing a

<li>What is the GIL in Python? How does it affect multithreading?</li>
</ol>
<p>What: GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) is a mutex in CPython that allows
only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.</p>
<p>How: It prevents true parallel execution of CPU-bound tasks in
multithreading. I/O-bound tasks are less affected. To bypass this, use

<ol type="1">
<li>Vue.js Q&amp;A</li>
</ol>
<p>Q: How does Vue achieve two-way data binding?</p>
<p>What: Vue uses the v-model directive.</p>
<p>How: It binds input values to component data and updates
automatically via event listeners. Vue2 used Object.defineProperty, Vue3
uses Proxy.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<input v-model="message" />
<p>
{{ message }}
</p>
<p>Q: What are Vue lifecycle hooks?</p>
<p>What: Lifecycle hooks allow running code at different stages of a
component.</p>
<p>How: Examples include created, mounted, updated, destroyed.</p>
<p>Example: Use mounted() to fetch data after DOM is ready.</p>
<p>Q: What’s the difference between v-if and v-show?</p>
<p>v-if: Conditionally renders elements, removes/re-creates them. Good
for infrequent toggles.</p>
<p>v-show: Controls display style, element always exists. Good for
frequent toggles.</p>
<p>Q: How does parent-child communication work in Vue?</p>
<p>Parent → Child: Use props.</p>
<p>Child → Parent: Use $emit.</p>
<p>Non-related components: Use EventBus or Vuex.</p>

analyze degraded performance. <em>How:</em> Examine load metrics,
network latency, database queries, and logs to find bottlenecks.
<em>Example:</em> A spike in DB slow queries indicated missing indexes;
adding them restored normal response times.</p></li>
<li><p>Alert Monitoring System Design <em>What:</em> Blueprint for
comprehensive alerting. <em>How:</em> Cover infrastructure and core
services, monitor SLOs, implement escalation policies, and automate
remediation when possible. <em>Example:</em> Integrating Alertmanager
webhooks with runbooks triggered autoscaling actions before paging
humans.</p></li>
<li><p>FinOps Tooling and Methodology <em>What:</em> Practices for cloud
cost management. <em>How:</em> Use tools like Kubecost, OpenCost, Cloud
Custodian; drive cross-functional collaboration, maintain real-time cost
visibility, and continuously optimize spend. <em>Example:</em> Kubecost
reports uncovered over-provisioned staging clusters, leading to
right-sizing that saved 20% monthly.</p></li>
<li><p>Chaos Engineering Tooling <em>What:</em> Open-source frameworks
for resilience testing. <em>How:</em> Leverage Chaos Monkey,
LitmusChaos, Chaos Toolkit, Gremlin CE, Pumba, PowerfulSeal,
Kube-monkey, Toxiproxy, and Mangle to inject controlled failures.
<em>Example:</em> Running LitmusChaos experiments on pod disruptions
validated that our auto-healing policies restored services within
SLO.</p></li>
<li><p>Chaos Engineering Methodology <em>What:</em> Structured approach
to resilience experiments. <em>How:</em> Define steady state, test in
production-like environments, start small, iterate continuously, and
learn from results. <em>Example:</em> Weekly chaos game days introduced
incremental fault scenarios, revealing a missing retry policy that we
promptly fixed.</p></li>
