# Interview QA Guide

This guide aggregates interview materials across operations, DevOps, observability, and AI Ops domains.

## Self-Introduction Context

Hello, I'm Haitao Pan. I have 14 years of experience in IT, I’ve supported different types of enterprise clients. My core skills are in Linux, containers, cloud and automation, with a strong focus on observability.

My background:

1. Started at CS2C, working on Linux porting and RPM automation.
2. At Inspur and Knownsec, I focused on scaling ops and automation, and at Deepin Linux I worked on productizing Deepin Server
3. At Alauda, UCloud, and Eccom, I worked on enterprise projects around containers, cloud, and DevOps automation.
4. At Tesla Shanghai, standardized SRE practices around CI/CD and application operations.
5. Most recently at Yunshan Networks, focused on NPM/APM, eBPF, and Kubernetes performance troubleshooting for customers.

My career path follows "Linux Server → Containers/Public Cloud → Enterprise IaC/DevOps → Full-stack Observability." 

I currently concentrate on LLM-Ops: blending observability data with RAG and AI Agents to build reliability-focused automation loops that help teams deliver faster and more reliably.

## Self-Introduction 20-second Pitch

14 years in IT: Linux/K8s/IaC/DevOps leading into observability. Experience spans Deepin, Alauda, UCloud, Roche projects, Tesla SRE, and Yunshan customer support. Now focused on LLM-Ops, connecting RAG/Agents with observability systems to create faster, more stable automated operations.

## Responding to Recent Layoffs

I was impacted by layoffs in my recent positions, but my performance was not an issue.

# Knowledge Map

## Overview

This series focuses on the core technical areas of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), with emphasis on cloud-native infrastructure, automation, and DevOps practices. It covers open-ended problem-solving skills, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform/Ansible/Helm, modern CI/CD and GitOps workflows (GitHub Actions + ArgoCD), observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK), and troubleshooting in Linux, Kubernetes, and public cloud platforms (AWS/Azure).
