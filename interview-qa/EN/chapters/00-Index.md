# Interview QA Guide

This guide aggregates interview materials across operations, DevOps, observability, and AI Ops domains.

# Self-Introduction Context

Hello, I'm Haitao Pan. I have 14 years of experience in IT, having supported organizations in manufacturing, finance, telecommunications, and the internet sector. My core skills center on Linux/Kubernetes, Terraform/Ansible, Docker, and DevOps, with long-term focus on observability and performance tuning.

My background:
1. Started at CS2C, working on Linux porting and RPM automation.
2. Scaled operations and automation at Inspur and Knownsec; contributed to Deepin/UnionTech on productizing Deepin Server.
3. After moving into cloud-native, delivered a banking container platform at Alauda and led cloud and hybrid-cloud solutions at UCloud.
4. Implemented Terraform + GitOps + Datadog for Roche at HighSun; at Tesla Shanghai, standardized SRE practices around CI/CD and application operations.
5. Most recently at Yunshan Networks, focused on NPM/APM, eBPF, and Kubernetes performance troubleshooting for customers.

My career path follows "Linux foundations → Containers/Public Cloud → Enterprise IaC/DevOps → Full-stack Observability." I currently concentrate on LLM-Ops: blending observability data with RAG and AI Agents to build reliability-focused automation loops that help teams deliver faster and more reliably.

14 years in IT: Linux/K8s/IaC/DevOps leading into observability. Experience spans Deepin, Alauda, UCloud, Roche projects, Tesla SRE, and Yunshan customer support. Now focused on LLM-Ops, connecting RAG/Agents with observability systems to create faster, more stable automated operations.

# Responding to Recent Layoffs

My recent role changes stemmed from organizational optimization and project downsizing that led to platform roles being merged or eliminated; they were unrelated to performance. I consistently closed out delivery and handover work. Now I’m focused on the value I can bring immediately to your Kubernetes/IaC/observability platform. I’ve already fully answered this topic, and it had nothing to do with performance. If there are no other questions about role fit, I suggest we move on to my project experience to assess alignment with your needs.

English quick response (for multinational or returnee interviews)

Polite and firm:

I’ve fully addressed the reason—it was organizational restructuring and platform consolidation, not performance. If there are no further fit-related questions, I suggest we move to my project track record and see how it maps to your needs.
