## **ELK**

Elasticsearch (ES) and related technologies involve deep discussions on indexing principles, storage mechanisms, performance optimization, and architecture design. Below are brief answers to each topic:

### 1. **ES Indexing Principle**

- Elasticsearch writes documents to one or more shards, each of which is a Lucene index. Documents are written to an in-memory transaction log (translog) and are periodically flushed to Lucene index files on disk.

### 2. **ES Storage Principle**

- Elasticsearch uses the Lucene library to store data. Data is partitioned into shards, each having its own inverted index, storage files, and transaction log. Data is stored in the form of JSON documents.

### 3. **Full-text Search in ES**

- Queries are parsed and transformed into Lucene queries. ES looks up matching documents in the inverted index, calculates relevance scores, and returns the matching results.
- **ES Write Performance Optimization**: Use bulk operations, adjust index refresh frequency, optimize the number and size of shards, configure appropriate memory and filesystem settings, and tune merge policies.

### 4. **ES Query Performance Optimization**

- Optimize index mappings, fine-tune query syntax, use caches (e.g., query cache), configure the appropriate number of shards and replicas, and monitor and adjust JVM memory settings.

### 5. **Troubleshooting High JVM Usage in ES**

- Monitor JVM garbage collection (GC) logs, analyze heap memory usage, check for thread and lock contention, and optimize ES configuration by adjusting heap size and garbage collectors.

### 6. **ES Fleet Server Architecture**

- **Fleet**: A component of the Elastic Stack for centralized management of Elastic Agents. It provides a unified interface for managing and monitoring Elastic Agent instances.

### 7. **Comparison of ClickHouse, Loki, and ES**

- **ClickHouse**: Best suited for high-performance, real-time analytics, especially for large-scale data aggregation queries.
- **Loki**: Focuses on log data collection and storage, optimized for large-scale log data handling.
- **ES**: Provides robust full-text search and flexible querying, ideal for scenarios requiring powerful search and analysis capabilities.

### 8. **ES Full GC Troubleshooting**

- Check JVM GC logs, analyze the cause of Full GC, adjust heap size and garbage collector settings, and optimize ES indexing and query configurations.

### 9. **Difference Between Young GC and Old GC in ES**

- **Young GC**: Focuses on collecting garbage in the young generation, occurring frequently for newly created objects.
- **Old GC**: Collects garbage in the old generation, occurring less frequently but taking longer, dealing with long-lived objects.

### 10. **Purpose of ES Versioning**

- The `version` field resolves concurrent update issues, ensuring that document updates do not overwrite other client updates.

### 11. **ES Aggregation Types**

- **Bucket Aggregation**: Groups documents into buckets, e.g., by date, category.
- **Metric Aggregation**: Performs calculations on numeric data, e.g., sum, average.
- **Pipeline Aggregation**: Performs further calculations on aggregation results, such as moving averages.

### 14. **How Filebeat Ensures Continuous Log Shipping**

- Filebeat uses built-in log rotation and retry mechanisms, ensuring continued log shipping even in the event of network failures or Filebeat restarts.
