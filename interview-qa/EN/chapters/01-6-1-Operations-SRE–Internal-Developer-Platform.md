## Internal Developer Platform (IDP) Interview Guide

1. Definition and Goals
*What:* An IDP is a curated set of self-service tools, workflows, and infrastructure abstractions for developers.
*How:* Provide standardized templates, golden paths, and automated guardrails that enable teams to ship quickly without deep platform knowledge.
*Example:* Developers request a new microservice via a portal that provisions repo scaffolding, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes namespaces automatically.

2. Core Components
*What:* Elements such as service catalogs, provisioning engines, observability, and deployment automation.
*How:* Integrate a portal (Backstage), infrastructure orchestration (Terraform, Crossplane), CI/CD, and centralized monitoring/logging.
*Example:* Backstage displayed all services with links to Grafana dashboards and Argo CD applications for one-click troubleshooting.

3. Golden Paths and Templates
*What:* Opinionated starter kits for common workloads.
*How:* Maintain templates for APIs, batch jobs, and data pipelines with preconfigured security, testing, and deployment workflows.
*Example:* Spinning up a Node.js API template delivered linting, container build, Helm chart, and SLO monitoring pre-wired.

4. Self-Service Provisioning
*What:* Empowering teams to request infrastructure on demand.
*How:* Expose Terraform modules or Crossplane claims via UI/CLI, enforce policy-as-code, and automate approvals.
*Example:* A product team provisioned an RDS instance through the IDP portal; policies ensured encryption and tagging before applying.

5. Governance and Guardrails
*What:* Controls ensuring compliance and reliability.
*How:* Embed security scans, cost budgets, and SLO enforcement into platform workflows, and use OPA/Sentinel for policy checks.
*Example:* The platform blocked deployments missing required secrets rotation annotations, prompting developers to fix configs pre-release.

6. Platform Observability
*What:* Monitoring the platform itself and delivered services.
*How:* Instrument IDP components, expose health dashboards, and set alerts on onboarding success, deployment success rate, and resource usage.
*Example:* A drop in template provisioning success triggered an alert that led to fixing a broken Terraform provider.

7. Developer Experience Feedback
*What:* Continuous improvement through user feedback.
*How:* Collect NPS surveys, office hours, and usage analytics; iterate on workflows based on pain points.
*Example:* Survey feedback prompted adding automated database migration scaffolding, reducing onboarding time by half.

8. Multi-Tenancy and Isolation
*What:* Supporting multiple teams with safe resource boundaries.
*How:* Use namespace isolation, network policies, IAM roles, and quota management to separate tenants.
*Example:* Each squad received its own Kubernetes namespace with resource quotas and network policies applied by the platform.

9. Integration with Existing Tooling
*What:* Harmonizing the IDP with legacy systems.
*How:* Provide connectors for SCM, ticketing, secrets management, and incident response tools.
*Example:* Creating a new service automatically registered PagerDuty rotations and linked Jira components for issue tracking.

10. Lifecycle Management
*What:* Handling upgrades, deprecations, and retirement of services.
*How:* Version templates, communicate lifecycle changes, and offer migration tooling plus sunset policies.
*Example:* When upgrading the base container image, the platform opened automated PRs to update all services and tracked adoption progress.

11. Security and Compliance
*What:* Maintaining secure defaults across the platform.
*How:* Integrate SAST/DAST, enforce least-privilege roles, manage secrets centrally, and audit actions.
*Example:* Vault integration injected short-lived credentials into pipelines, and access logs fed into SIEM for compliance reporting.

12. Cost Management
*What:* Visibility and control over spend.
*How:* Tag resources, aggregate cost metrics per team, and provide dashboards plus budget alerts.
*Example:* Monthly cost reports from the IDP portal highlighted an idle staging cluster, prompting rightsizing.

13. Onboarding Workflow
*What:* Steps for new engineers to become productive.
*How:* Offer guided tutorials, sample services, and sandbox environments accessible via single sign-on.
*Example:* A new hire completed a 30-minute quest building a demo service, deploying it, and viewing metricsâ€”all through the platform.

14. Incident Response Integration
*What:* Connecting the platform to reliability processes.
*How:* Auto-link runbooks, service ownership, and alert routing; ensure on-call contacts are surfaced in the portal.
*Example:* Clicking a service in Backstage displayed on-call details, runbooks, and recent incidents, accelerating triage.

15. Measuring Platform Success
*What:* KPIs demonstrating value.
*How:* Track deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, onboarding duration, and developer satisfaction.
*Example:* After launching the IDP, deployment lead time dropped from 3 days to 6 hours, confirming the platformâ€™s impact.

## Python

1. What is the GIL in Python? How does it affect multithreading?

What: GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) is a mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.

How: It prevents true parallel execution of CPU-bound tasks in multithreading. I/O-bound tasks are less affected. To bypass this, use multiprocessing or asyncio.

Example: Running CPU-heavy computation in threads will not scale across multiple cores due to GIL.

2. What are decorators in Python?

What: A decorator is a higher-order function that takes a function and returns a new function with modified behavior.

How: It is often used for logging, performance measurement, or access control.

Example:

def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before")
        func()
        print("After")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()

3. What is the difference between is and ==?

What: is checks object identity (same memory address). == checks value equality.

How: Use is for singleton objects (None, True, False), and == for comparing values.

Example:

a = [1,2]; b = [1,2]
a == b   # True
a is b   # False

4. What is the difference between generators and iterators?

What: An iterator implements __iter__() and __next__(). A generator is a special iterator created using yield.

How: Generators compute values lazily and can only be iterated once.

Example:

def gen():
    for i in range(3):
        yield i
for x in gen():
    print(x)

5. How does Python garbage collection work?

What: Python uses reference counting as the main strategy, plus mark-and-sweep and generational GC.

How: When reference count drops to zero, memory is freed. Cyclic references are handled by mark-and-sweep.

Example: Two objects referencing each other get cleaned up by GC even if ref count doesnâ€™t reach zero.

6. What is a context manager in Python?

What: A context manager defines resource setup and cleanup using __enter__ and __exit__.

How: It is used with the with statement.

Example:

with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

7. What is the internal implementation of Python dictionaries?

What: Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables.

How: Keys are hashed, and values are stored in slots. Collisions are handled with open addressing. Average lookup is O(1).

Example: Accessing my_dict["key"] is O(1) on average.

8. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?

What: Shallow copy copies references to objects; deep copy recursively copies all nested objects.

How: Use copy.copy() for shallow, copy.deepcopy() for deep.

Example:

import copy
a = [[1,2]]
b = copy.copy(a)   # shallow
c = copy.deepcopy(a) # deep

9. When should you use lambda functions?

What: Lambda is an anonymous inline function.

How: Use it for short, throwaway functions.

Example:

sorted_list = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x.age)

10. How do you implement Singleton in Python?

What: Singleton ensures only one instance of a class exists.

How: Override __new__ to control instantiation.

Example:

class Singleton:
    _instance = None
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

11. How do you write asynchronous code with asyncio?

What: asyncio is a library for asynchronous programming using coroutines.

How: Use async and await to run I/O tasks concurrently.

Example:

import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "data"

async def main():
    print(await fetch_data())

asyncio.run(main())
