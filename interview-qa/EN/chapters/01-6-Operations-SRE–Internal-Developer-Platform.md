Internal Developer Platform (IDP) Interview Guide

1. Definition and Goals
*What:* An IDP is a curated set of self-service tools, workflows, and infrastructure abstractions for developers.
*How:* Provide standardized templates, golden paths, and automated guardrails that enable teams to ship quickly without deep platform knowledge.
*Example:* Developers request a new microservice via a portal that provisions repo scaffolding, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes namespaces automatically.

2. Core Components
*What:* Elements such as service catalogs, provisioning engines, observability, and deployment automation.
*How:* Integrate a portal (Backstage), infrastructure orchestration (Terraform, Crossplane), CI/CD, and centralized monitoring/logging.
*Example:* Backstage displayed all services with links to Grafana dashboards and Argo CD applications for one-click troubleshooting.

3. Golden Paths and Templates
*What:* Opinionated starter kits for common workloads.
*How:* Maintain templates for APIs, batch jobs, and data pipelines with preconfigured security, testing, and deployment workflows.
*Example:* Spinning up a Node.js API template delivered linting, container build, Helm chart, and SLO monitoring pre-wired.

4. Self-Service Provisioning
*What:* Empowering teams to request infrastructure on demand.
*How:* Expose Terraform modules or Crossplane claims via UI/CLI, enforce policy-as-code, and automate approvals.
*Example:* A product team provisioned an RDS instance through the IDP portal; policies ensured encryption and tagging before applying.

5. Governance and Guardrails
*What:* Controls ensuring compliance and reliability.
*How:* Embed security scans, cost budgets, and SLO enforcement into platform workflows, and use OPA/Sentinel for policy checks.
*Example:* The platform blocked deployments missing required secrets rotation annotations, prompting developers to fix configs pre-release.

6. Platform Observability
*What:* Monitoring the platform itself and delivered services.
*How:* Instrument IDP components, expose health dashboards, and set alerts on onboarding success, deployment success rate, and resource usage.
*Example:* A drop in template provisioning success triggered an alert that led to fixing a broken Terraform provider.

7. Developer Experience Feedback
*What:* Continuous improvement through user feedback.
*How:* Collect NPS surveys, office hours, and usage analytics; iterate on workflows based on pain points.
*Example:* Survey feedback prompted adding automated database migration scaffolding, reducing onboarding time by half.

8. Multi-Tenancy and Isolation
*What:* Supporting multiple teams with safe resource boundaries.
*How:* Use namespace isolation, network policies, IAM roles, and quota management to separate tenants.
*Example:* Each squad received its own Kubernetes namespace with resource quotas and network policies applied by the platform.

9. Integration with Existing Tooling
*What:* Harmonizing the IDP with legacy systems.
*How:* Provide connectors for SCM, ticketing, secrets management, and incident response tools.
*Example:* Creating a new service automatically registered PagerDuty rotations and linked Jira components for issue tracking.

10. Lifecycle Management
*What:* Handling upgrades, deprecations, and retirement of services.
*How:* Version templates, communicate lifecycle changes, and offer migration tooling plus sunset policies.
*Example:* When upgrading the base container image, the platform opened automated PRs to update all services and tracked adoption progress.

11. Security and Compliance
*What:* Maintaining secure defaults across the platform.
*How:* Integrate SAST/DAST, enforce least-privilege roles, manage secrets centrally, and audit actions.
*Example:* Vault integration injected short-lived credentials into pipelines, and access logs fed into SIEM for compliance reporting.

12. Cost Management
*What:* Visibility and control over spend.
*How:* Tag resources, aggregate cost metrics per team, and provide dashboards plus budget alerts.
*Example:* Monthly cost reports from the IDP portal highlighted an idle staging cluster, prompting rightsizing.

13. Onboarding Workflow
*What:* Steps for new engineers to become productive.
*How:* Offer guided tutorials, sample services, and sandbox environments accessible via single sign-on.
*Example:* A new hire completed a 30-minute quest building a demo service, deploying it, and viewing metrics—all through the platform.

14. Incident Response Integration
*What:* Connecting the platform to reliability processes.
*How:* Auto-link runbooks, service ownership, and alert routing; ensure on-call contacts are surfaced in the portal.
*Example:* Clicking a service in Backstage displayed on-call details, runbooks, and recent incidents, accelerating triage.

15. Measuring Platform Success
*What:* KPIs demonstrating value.
*How:* Track deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, onboarding duration, and developer satisfaction.
*Example:* After launching the IDP, deployment lead time dropped from 3 days to 6 hours, confirming the platform’s impact.
