*What:* Optimizing service levels against budget constraints.
*How:* Set business-aligned SLOs, analyze cost-benefit of redundancy, and right-size resources.
*Example:* Reducing a service from 99.99% to 99.9% availability saved substantial multi-region costs without harming user experience.

17. Stability vs. New Technology Adoption
*What:* Safely introducing emerging tools.
*How:* Pilot in lower environments, use canary deployments, and monitor impact before broad rollout.
*Example:* We introduced a service mesh via canary clusters, validating latency overhead before cluster-wide adoption.

18. Reducing Low-Value Repetitive Tasks
*What:* Eliminating toil to focus on higher-impact work.
*How:* Identify repetitive tasks, automate via scripts or workflows, and reassign effort to engineering improvements.
