Open-ended questions
SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) and observability are key concepts in operations work. These questions cover different levels of operational practices and concepts. Below is a brief response to some of the questions:

1.Understanding SRE Principles
SRE is a concept that applies software engineering methods to operations with the aim of improving system reliability and efficiency. It emphasizes automating and programming repetitive tasks to ensure high service availability. SRE typically uses SLOs (Service Level Objectives) and SLAs (Service Level Agreements) to set acceptable system performance standards and manages the balance between system stability and innovation through error budgets.

2. Observability
Observability refers to the ability to infer the internal state of a system from its external outputs. It is primarily achieved through logs, metrics, and tracing, helping operations teams quickly diagnose issues.

3. Handling Major Failures in Operations
Major failures are often related to network or database outages. Addressing such issues requires multi-layered investigation, including application logs, network status, and database health, to identify the root cause and restore service while ensuring a disaster recovery plan is in place.

4. Handling Failures Caused by Human Error
Risks of human error can be mitigated through strict change management, permission controls, and rollback mechanisms. When a failure occurs, the first step is to quickly roll back or fix the issue, followed by a post-mortem review to improve processes and auditing mechanisms.

5. Learning New Technologies
Learning new technologies is achieved by reading documentation, participating in open source projects, practicing with new tools, and attending technical forums and online courses. Continuous learning and practice are crucial.

6. Current Technical Focus
Recent areas of focus may include cloud-native technologies, container orchestration, automation tools (such as Ansible and Terraform), and observability toolchains (such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki).

7. Building an Operations Framework
Building an operations framework typically includes monitoring and alerting, backup and recovery, CI/CD automation, log management, security management, change management, and resource optimization.

8. Fault Event Management and Alert System Design
Fault event management generally involves classifying alert levels, having an emergency response plan, notification mechanisms, and post-event reviews. The coverage of alerts can be determined by assessing the comprehensiveness of monitoring metrics, and accuracy is measured by avoiding false positives and negatives.

9. Roles and Collaboration with Other Teams
Operations focus on system stability, while development focuses on functionality. The collaboration model involves working together, with operations providing tools and platform support.

10.Future Directions for Operations
Future directions include moving towards automation and intelligence, such as AIOps, cloud-native operations, and deeper integration with DevOps.

11.Focus Areas in Operations
Focus areas include monitoring system stability, ensuring high availability, emergency response and recovery, and optimizing system performance.

12.Improving Work Efficiency
Efficiency can be improved through automation tools, standardized processes, and reducing repetitive tasks.

13.Fault Summary Content
The content should include the cause of the fault, impact scope, solution, improvement measures, and responsibility allocation.

14.Automation Efficiency vs. Manual Verification
Automation enhances efficiency, but critical operations should retain manual verification to ensure safety.

15.Balancing Stability and Innovation in Operations
Balance stability and innovation through error budgets, setting reasonable SLOs.

16.Reliability vs. Cost
Set reasonable SLOs/SLAs based on business needs; excessive reliability can lead to unnecessary costs.

17.Stability vs. New Technology Practice
Use progressive deployment and canary releases to validate the impact of new technologies on stability.

18.Reducing Low-Value Repetitive Tasks
Use automation tools to minimize low-value repetitive tasks and focus on higher-level optimization work.

19.Avoiding Alert Noise
Optimize alert thresholds and tiered notifications to ensure accuracy and urgency of alerts.

20.CMDB Design
Design should cover all IT assets and their dependencies, ensuring real-time updates and high availability.

21.Automation Rate
Target an automation coverage rate of over 90% based on team maturity.

22.Disagreement with Superior's Opinions
Base arguments on data and facts, present strong evidence, and seek reasonable consensus.

23.Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths include strong sense of responsibility and solid technical skills; weaknesses may involve excessive focus on details, potentially impacting progress.

24.Core Competencies
Broad technical background, deep understanding of system stability, proficiency in automation, and efficient problem diagnosis.

25.Homepage White Screen Timeout Reasons
Possible reasons include network issues, load balancer misconfigurations, service delays, or frontend resource loading failures.

26.Slow Response Service Troubleshooting Process
Check load, network latency, database queries, and log analysis to identify bottlenecks.

27.Alert Monitoring System Design
Include tiered alerts, SLO monitoring, cover core services and infrastructure, and provide automated remediation mechanisms.
