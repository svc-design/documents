# 3-Step Skill Pitch

- 每次回答控制在 25s 内 “First, I did… Then, I… Finally, we…”这样的结构。可以先写下来，再口头练习，确保语法正确、逻辑清 晰。
- 如果面试官直接问你 “What are your main skills?” 或 “你有哪些技能？”，建议用 结构化 + 简洁 的方式回答。 推荐公式：分类 → 技术点 → 成果/价值。
- 如果每句话都机械用 so that，听起来会啰嗦。可以在结构上做一些 自然变换，保持逻辑连贯但不显重复。常见替代：
- which helps …
- allowing us to …
- this way …
- enabling …
- to …（直接用动词不定式简化）

示例 1：运维 / SRE 技能

I have strong skills in Linux and cloud platforms, which helps me manage systems efficiently.
I focus on automation with Terraform and GitHub Actions, allowing deployments to be faster and safer.
I’m experienced in observability with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, so that issues are detected early.

示例 2：DevOps 工程师技能

My core skills are in CI/CD pipelines, to ensure continuous and reliable delivery.
I use Kubernetes and Argo CD to deploy applications, which reduces manual errors.
I manage cloud resources with Terraform, enabling infrastructure to be consistent and scalable.

示例 3：可观测性技能

I’m skilled in monitoring, logging, and tracing, so that systems stay transparent.
I set up Grafana, Loki, and OpenTelemetry, this way performance issues become visible in real time.
This helps teams optimize their applications, improving the user experience.


示例 4：自动化部署项目

英文口语版：
First, I set up GitHub Actions to build and test our applications automatically.
Then, I integrated Argo CD to deploy these builds into our Kubernetes environment.
Finally, we achieved a fully automated CI/CD pipeline, which reduced release time and improved reliability.

示例 5：自动化测试流程

英文口语版：
First, I created test workflows in GitHub Actions to run unit and integration tests.
Then, I connected the results to Argo CD so only passing builds were deployed.
Finally, we improved code quality and prevented broken releases from reaching production.

示例 6：跨团队协作

英文口语版：
First, I worked with developers to define deployment standards.
Then, I automated the delivery pipeline using GitHub Actions and Argo CD.
Finally, we made deployments consistent across teams and reduced manual errors.
