Strong hands-on background in Linux, AWS, Kubernetes, and IaC (Terraform/Pulumi).
Delivered large-scale migrations (on-prem → AWS, monolith → containers).
Experienced in leading small teams, mentoring juniors, and driving automation adoption.

I combine deep technical expertise with practical leadership.

Follow-up:
“What’s one technical project where you acted as both engineer and leader?”

2. AWS Architecture

Interviewer:
“Design a secure and highly available AWS environment for a regulated industry (e.g., finance). How would you approach it?”

参考答案要点 (Candidate):
Multi-account setup with Organizations + Control Tower.
Networking: VPC with private/public subnets, Transit Gateway, NAT Gateway, PrivateLink.
Security & compliance: IAM roles, KMS, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Config rules.
IaC: Terraform modules, version-controlled and reviewed in CI/CD.
Reliability: Multi-AZ EKS clusters, backups, cross-region disaster recovery.

Follow-up:
“How do you enforce compliance across multiple AWS accounts?”

3. IaC Management

Interviewer:
“How do you manage Terraform at scale across teams and environments?”

参考答案要点 (Candidate):

Modular design: reusable components (network, eks, iam, rds).
Remote state (S3 + DynamoDB lock), workspaces per environment.
CI/CD integration: plan → review → apply with approval gates.
Policy enforcement: OPA/Conftest, tagging standards, pre-commit hooks.
Rollback: versioned modules and “last known good” states.

Follow-up:
“What’s your strategy when a Terraform apply partially fails in production?”

4. Containerized Application Release

Interviewer:
“How would you design a safe release process for apps running on AWS EKS?”

参考答案要点 (Candidate):

GitOps with ArgoCD/Flux.

Deployment strategies: rolling, blue/green, canary.

Monitoring-driven rollback with Prometheus + alert thresholds.

Autoscaling: HPA for pods, Cluster Autoscaler for nodes.

Secure supply chain: image scanning, signed artifacts.

Follow-up:
“How would you troubleshoot a CrashLoopBackOff in production?”

5. Incident & Operations Leadership

Interviewer:
“Imagine a release caused an outage in production. How do you lead the incident response?”

参考答案要点 (Candidate):

Declare incident, assign clear roles (incident commander, fixers, comms).

Contain impact: rollback deployment or redeploy stable version.

Continuous communication with stakeholders and client.

After incident: root cause analysis, blameless post-mortem, improve runbooks.

Follow-up:
“How do you ensure similar failures don’t happen again?”

6. Outsourcing & Client Management

Document handover + training for client teams.

Follow-up:
“What would you do if a client insists on speed over security?”

7. Leadership & 90-Day Plan

Interviewer:
“If you join us, what would be your 90-day plan as an Ops Lead?”

参考答案要点 (Candidate):

First 30 days: Assess infra, CI/CD, monitoring, cost.
Next 30 days: Standardize IaC baseline, introduce GitOps pipeline, set compliance checks.
Last 30 days: Improve reliability (HA, autoscaling), cost optimization, mentor team.

Follow-up:
“How would you coach junior engineers to move from executing tasks to designing solutions?”
