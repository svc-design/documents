想模拟的是：你是一个资深运维工程师，而面试官是 国外的运维技术主管 (Ops/DevOps Lead)，从 面试官的视角 来看看会问你什么问题。
我来整理出一份 技术主管面试官提问清单（围绕 AWS、IaC、容器应用发布），这些问题会考察你的 技术深度、架构理解、故障处理、团队协作。

Hello, my name is Haitao Pan, but you can call me Harry, it’s easier.

一个整体化的面试回答框架，把 IaC → 可观测性 → DevOps 综合能力 → 未来发展 串联成一条清晰的职业成长线。这样不仅能展示技术栈，还能突出逻辑性与未来潜力。下面给你一个 结构化回答模版 + 口语速答版。

🌐 完整版（结构化回答）

1. IaC (基础设施即代码)
“I have strong experience with Infrastructure as Code. For example, I used Terraform to provision cloud resources like VPCs, Kubernetes clusters, and databases. By storing everything in Git and integrating it into CI/CD pipelines, we made infrastructure changes consistent, reviewable, and automated.”

2. 可观测性 (Observability)
“On top of that, I worked on observability—deploying Prometheus and Grafana for metrics, Loki for logs, and Jaeger for tracing. This gave the team full visibility and reduced our mean time to recovery during incidents.”

3. DevOps 综合技能
“Combining IaC and observability, I built end-to-end CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Argo CD. I automated testing, deployment, and monitoring, which improved release speed and system reliability. These projects show my ability to connect development and operations into one workflow.”

4. 未来发展方向
“My career goal is to grow into a platform engineering leader. I want to scale these practices beyond individual projects—by setting platform standards, mentoring engineers, and leading initiatives that improve reliability, cost efficiency, and developer productivity.”

“I’ve used Terraform for IaC to automate infrastructure, and I added observability with Prometheus and Grafana for full visibility. I also built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Argo CD to speed up deployments and improve reliability. Going forward, I want to grow into a platform engineering leader who drives standards and mentors teams.”

I have strong skills in Linux and cloud platforms, which helps me manage systems efficiently.
I focus on automation with Terraform and GitHub Actions, allowing deployments to be faster and safer.
I’m experienced in observability with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, so that issues are detected early.

示例 2：DevOps 工程师技能

My core skills are in CI/CD pipelines, to ensure continuous and reliable delivery.
I use Kubernetes and Argo CD to deploy applications, which reduces manual errors.
I manage cloud resources with Terraform, enabling infrastructure to be consistent and scalable.

示例 3：可观测性技能

I’m skilled in monitoring, logging, and tracing, so that systems stay transparent.
I set up Grafana, Loki, and OpenTelemetry, this way performance issues become visible in real time.
This helps teams optimize their applications, improving the user experience.

把 IaC → 可观测性 → DevOps → 未来发展 串联进一个 STAR+Future 故事版回答：

🌟 STAR 模式 + Future

Situation（情境）
“In one of my recent roles, our team needed a more reliable way to manage infrastructure and support faster deployments. We also lacked visibility when issues happened in production.”

Task（任务）
“My responsibility was to improve both infrastructure management and system reliability, while reducing manual effort for the team.”

Action（行动）
“So I introduced Infrastructure as Code with Terraform to standardize how we provisioned resources like VPCs and Kubernetes clusters. I also set up observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki, giving the team metrics, logs, and alerts in one place. Finally, I built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Argo CD, which automated testing, deployments, and monitoring.”

Result（结果）
“As a result, our infrastructure became consistent, deployments went from hours to minutes, and incidents were resolved faster thanks to full observability. The team gained confidence in releasing changes more frequently.”

Future（未来）
“Looking ahead, I want to scale this impact by becoming a platform engineering leader—someone who not only builds automation and observability, but also sets standards, mentors engineers, and drives initiatives that improve reliability and developer productivity across the organization.”

⚡ 速答口语版（3–4 句）
“In my last role, I used Terraform for IaC, added observability with Prometheus and Grafana, and built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Argo CD. This made infrastructure consistent, deployments faster, and incidents easier to resolve. In the future, I want to grow into a platform engineering leader to scale these practices and mentor teams.”


🎯 面试官可能会问的问题清单
一、AWS 基础与架构

“How do you design a secure and highly available VPC architecture on AWS?”
“What’s the difference between using EC2, EKS, and ECS for workloads? When would you choose each?”
“How do you implement centralized logging and monitoring across multiple AWS accounts?”
“Can you walk me through how you would implement cross-region disaster recovery?”

二、IaC (Terraform / Pulumi / CloudFormation)

“How do you organize Terraform modules for different environments (dev/stage/prod)?”
“How do you manage Terraform state in a team to avoid conflicts and drift?”
“What’s your strategy for rolling back infrastructure changes if something goes wrong?”
“Have you used policy-as-code (like OPA/Conftest) to enforce compliance in IaC pipelines?”

三、容器与应用发布

“How would you design a deployment pipeline for applications running on EKS?”
“What’s the difference between rolling updates, blue-green, and canary deployments? Which do you prefer and why?”
“How do you troubleshoot a Kubernetes pod stuck in CrashLoopBackOff?”
“How would you secure the container supply chain (images, registries, runtime)?”

四、可观测性与运维

“How do you integrate Prometheus/Grafana/OpenTelemetry with AWS CloudWatch for observability?”
“Can you give an example of a major incident you handled? What was your role, and what did you learn?”
“How do you balance automation vs. manual control in incident management?”

五、团队协作与交付 (外包项目常见)

“What’s your approach to knowledge transfer and documentation for clients?”
“What would you do if the client insists on skipping compliance checks to deliver faster?”
“How do you work with developers to align release processes and infrastructure requirements?”

六、情景模拟题

交付与合作：外包环境下的交付质量、文档化、与客户沟通。



AWS / IaC / Container Release – Interview Quick Answers
🔹 Level 1 – Fundamentals

Q1. EC2 vs ECS vs EKS
👉 “EC2 gives full VM control, good for legacy workloads. ECS is simpler, AWS-managed containers. EKS is managed Kubernetes, better for portability and complex microservices. I’d choose based on control vs. simplicity vs. multi-cloud needs.”

Q2. Terraform state management
👉 “I store state remotely in S3 with DynamoDB locking. Each env uses workspaces or separate state files. We run Terraform in CI/CD, not locally, to avoid conflicts.”

Q3. CrashLoopBackOff troubleshooting
👉 “It means the pod keeps crashing after start. I’d check logs and kubectl describe to see if it’s config, env vars, or probes. Usually it’s a bad config or failing health check.”

🔹 Level 2 – Intermediate

Q4. Multi-account AWS design
👉 “I’d use AWS Organizations and Control Tower. Separate accounts for prod, dev, logging, security. Apply SCPs and centralize logs with CloudTrail and Config.”

Q5. Safe EKS deployments
👉 “I’d go GitOps with ArgoCD. Use rolling or canary deployments with metrics-based rollback. Add autoscaling and image scanning for security.”

Q6. Terraform rollback strategy
👉 “We always plan and review before apply. If something fails, redeploy the last good version from Git. I protect critical resources with prevent_destroy and run drift checks.”

🔹 Level 3 – Advanced / Final Round

Q7. Handling failed EKS deployment
👉 “First, declare an incident and assign roles. Roll back to a stable version to restore service. Then check logs and metrics, keep stakeholders updated, and run a post-mortem after.”

Q8. Enforcing IaC compliance
👉 “I’d use OPA or Conftest in the pipeline to block non-compliant code. All changes go through code review, and every IaC change is logged. This way we meet security standards.”

Q9. 90-day plan as Ops Engineer
👉 “First month I’d assess infra, pipelines, and costs. Second month I’d standardize Terraform modules and add compliance gates. Third month I’d improve reliability, autoscaling, and mentor the team.”

Q10. Example of major incident
👉 “We had an outage after a bad release. I rolled back quickly, found a config error, and updated the pipeline. Downtime stayed under 30 minutes, and we added an automated rollback.”
