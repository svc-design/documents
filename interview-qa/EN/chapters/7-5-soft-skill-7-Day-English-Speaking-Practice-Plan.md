### 速答技巧：

每个回答 结构一致：工具/行动 → 怎么做 → 带来的结果。
时态用过去式（worked, built, used），突出 你做过的事。
最后一句落在 价值 (improved reliability / reduced downtime / consistency / faster troubleshooting)。

1. 监控 / Observability

Q: Can you share your experience with monitoring systems?
A (3–4 句):
“I set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana to track application and infrastructure health. I added alerts for key metrics like latency and error rates, so the team could respond quickly. This improved reliability and reduced downtime during incidents.”

2. 基础设施即代码 (IaC)

Q: How have you used Infrastructure as Code in your work?
A (3–4 句):
“I used Terraform to provision cloud resources like VPCs, clusters, and databases. We stored code in Git and integrated it with CI/CD pipelines, so every change was reviewed and automated. This made infrastructure consistent and easier to scale.”

3. 可观测性 / Logging & Tracing

Q: What’s your approach to observability beyond metrics?
A (3–4 句):
“I deployed centralized logging with Loki and tracing with Jaeger to give us full visibility. Developers could correlate logs, metrics, and traces in Grafana to troubleshoot issues faster. This reduced mean time to recovery and improved developer confidence.”


动词过去式发音对照表
动词	过去式	音标	发音提示	示例句子
build	built	/bɪlt/	“比尔特”，短促结尾	I built a CI/CD pipeline.
deploy	deployed	/dɪˈplɔɪd/	结尾是 -d 音，读成“迪-普洛伊-德”	We deployed the app to Kubernetes.
maintain	maintained	/meɪnˈteɪnd/	结尾清楚的 -nd，读“曼-坦-德”	I maintained the monitoring system.
improve	improved	/ɪmˈpruːvd/	结尾是 -vd，嘴唇要合起来	We improved reliability.
automate	automated	/ˈɔːtəmeɪtɪd/	读“奥-托-梅-提德”	I automated deployments.
monitor	monitored	/ˈmɒnɪtərd/	结尾“特-儿-德”	I monitored system performance.
design	designed	/dɪˈzaɪnd/	结尾 -nd，读“迪-宰-恩-德”	I designed the network baseline.
implement	implemented	/ˈɪmplɪmentɪd/	读“因普利-门提德”	I implemented Terraform modules.
support	supported	/səˈpɔːrtɪd/	读“瑟-波尔-提德”	I supported production systems.
configure	configured	/kənˈfɪɡjərd/	结尾“格-耶-儿-德”	I configured monitoring alerts.
🎯 练习小技巧

分解读音 → 先读词根，再加上 -ed 或特殊过去式。

注意尾音 → 很多中国学习者容易吞掉 -d / -t，一定要读出来。

造句练习 → 每个动词用 1 句话说出来，模仿面试场景。


IT 单词易混发音表
单词 A	发音	单词 B	发音	区别/提示	示例
code (代码)	/koʊd/ → “扣德”	cold (冷的)	/koʊld/ → “扣尔德”	cold 多了一个 /l/ 音	I write clean code.
tool (工具)	/tuːl/ → “突尔”	two (数字 2)	/tuː/ → “突”	tool 带 /l/，舌尖抵上齿龈	Docker is a useful tool.
cache (缓存)	/kæʃ/ → “卡什”	cash (现金)	/kæʃ/ → “卡什”	发音几乎一样⚠️，需靠上下文区分	We use Redis as a cache.
data (数据)	/ˈdeɪtə/ 或 /ˈdætə/	date (日期)	/deɪt/ → “得特”	data 可两种读法，美音常 /ˈdeɪtə/	Data is stored in the database.
Linux	/ˈlɪnəks/ (更常用)	line	/laɪn/ → “赖因”	不要读成 “赖纳克斯”，正确是 “利纳克斯”	I work on Linux systems.
SQL	/ˈsiːkwəl/ (“sequel”)	S Q L	/ˌɛs kjuː ˈɛl/	两种都对，口语常说 sequel	We query data with SQL.

🎯 使用技巧

练对比 → 连续读 A-B-A-B，比如 code–cold, tool–two。

加例句 → 每个词造句，比如 We use cache to speed up queries.

录音自查 → 回放时注意尾音 (/d/、/l/、/tʃ/)。
