Interview Preparation: DevOps / SRE / Platform Engineering (English Version)
üîë Common Role Definitions (International Context)
1. Operations Engineer (Ops)

Role: Traditional IT operations ‚Äî system installation, configuration, monitoring, deployments.

Skills: Linux administration, networking, databases, middleware, Shell scripting.

Impression: Execution-focused, keeping systems stable.

Seen in: Traditional industries, outsourcing companies, smaller IT vendors.

2. Ops Developer / Automation Engineer

Role: Evolved Ops with coding ability ‚Äî builds automation scripts/tools.

Skills: Python/Golang, Ansible, Jenkins, API integrations.

Impression: ‚ÄúOps who can code,‚Äù often overlaps with entry-level DevOps.

Seen in: Finance, e-commerce, second-tier internet companies.

3. DevOps Engineer

Role: Focus on CI/CD pipelines, automated delivery, standardized environments.

Skills: Jenkins/GitLab CI, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD, Terraform.

Impression:

In large companies ‚Üí closer to Platform Engineering / Engineering Productivity.

In smaller companies ‚Üí basically Automation Ops with a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù title.

Seen in: Internet giants, SaaS/cloud-native companies.

4. Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

Role: Google‚Äôs SRE concept, adopted by many global companies.

Responsibilities:

Reliability engineering (SLA/SLO/SLI)

High availability design & chaos testing

Operating large-scale distributed systems

Building in-house reliability/automation tools

Skills: Go/Python, Kubernetes, Service Mesh, observability, chaos engineering.

Impression: Higher-level than DevOps, with strong engineering mindset.

Seen in: Google, Meta, Amazon, ByteDance, Alibaba, Tencent.

5. Platform Engineer

Role: Newer trend ‚Äî build and maintain internal developer platforms (CI/CD + container orchestration).

Difference:

Vs DevOps ‚Üí more productized, delivering ‚Äúplatform as a product.‚Äù

Vs SRE ‚Üí focuses on tools/platform, not directly accountable for SLAs.

Skills: Kubernetes Operators, GitOps, Terraform/Pulumi, cloud-native stack (Prometheus/Grafana/Argo).

Impression: Next-gen DevOps, often part of ‚ÄúPlatform / Productivity / Developer Experience‚Äù teams.

Seen in: Global tech firms, cloud-native startups.
